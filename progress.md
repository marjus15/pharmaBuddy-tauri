## 2026-10-05 — Side effects of the scanned medicine

- After a scan, the widget loads the public Galinos SPC excerpt under «Ανεπιθύμητες ενέργειες» and shows it under the medicine name.
- The excerpt is stored on `global_product_catalog.metadata.side_effects` (existing rows are updated only when that field is empty).
- `cache-catalog-entry` version 4 is deployed with that merge.
- The recommendation request includes the excerpt. The function source in `supabase/functions/get-ai-recommendation` tells the model to mention one relevant adverse effect and not to invent one.
